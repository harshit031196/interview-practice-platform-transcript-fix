```

### 2. Deploy the Analysis Cloud Function

```bash
# Make the deployment script executable
chmod +x deploy-video-analysis.sh

# Deploy the function
./deploy-video-analysis.sh
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Add to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Video Analysis Function URL (automatically set by deployment script)
VIDEO_ANALYSIS_FUNCTION_URL=https://your-region-your-project.cloudfunctions.net/analyze-video

# Google Cloud Storage bucket for videos
BUCKET_NAME=wingman-interview-videos

# Upload function endpoint
GENERATE_UPLOAD_URL_ENDPOINT=https://your-region-your-project.cloudfunctions.net/generate_upload_url
```

### 4. Create Storage Bucket

```bash
# Create the bucket for video storage
gsutil mb gs://wingman-interview-videos

# Set CORS policy for the bucket
gsutil cors set cloud-function/cors.json gs://wingman-interview-videos
```

- **B+ (75-79%)**: Good performance
- **B (70-74%)**: Above average performance
- **B- (65-69%)**: Average performance
- **C+ (60-64%)**: Below average performance
- **C (55-59%)**: Poor performance
- **C- (50-54%)**: Very poor performance
- **D+ (45-49%)**: Failing performance
- **D (40-44%)**: Very poor performance
- **F (0-39%)**: Unacceptable performance

### Component Scoring
- **Speech Clarity (60% weight)**: Based on pacing and filler words
- **Positivity (20% weight)**: Average joy emotion score
- **Confidence (20% weight)**: Eye contact, consistency, and stability

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Cloud Function Structure
```
cloud-function-video-analysis/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                 # Main analysis service
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # Function documentation
```

### Key Dependencies
- `google-cloud-speech`: Speech-to-Text API
- `google-cloud-vision`: Vision AI API
- `google-cloud-videointelligence`: Video Intelligence API
- `opencv-python`: Video frame extraction
- `numpy`: Numerical computations

### Analysis Pipeline
1. **Video Upload**: Secure upload to Google Cloud Storage
2. **Parallel Processing**: Speech, facial, and confidence analysis run simultaneously
3. **Frame Extraction**: Extract frames at 1-second intervals for visual analysis
4. **Speech Processing**: Convert audio to text with timestamps
5. **Facial Analysis**: Detect emotions in each frame
6. **Confidence Calculation**: Analyze head pose and eye contact
7. **Score Aggregation**: Combine all metrics into overall performance score

## üîí Security & Privacy

- All video uploads use signed URLs for secure transfer
- Videos are stored in private Google Cloud Storage buckets
- Analysis results can be downloaded and deleted after viewing
- User authentication required for all analysis operations

## üì± Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis Flow
1. User uploads interview video
2. System extracts audio and video frames
3. Parallel analysis of speech, facial expressions, and confidence
4. Results displayed in comprehensive dashboard
5. User can download detailed report

### Integration with Interview Practice
- Automatic analysis after AI interview sessions
- Historical performance tracking
- Improvement recommendations based on analysis
- Comparison with previous sessions

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Upload Failures**: Check CORS configuration and bucket permissions
2. **Analysis Timeouts**: Increase Cloud Function timeout for large videos
3. **Low Detection Confidence**: Ensure good lighting and clear video quality
4. **Missing Dependencies**: Verify all Google Cloud APIs are enabled

### Performance Optimization
- Use compressed video formats (WebM recommended)
- Limit video duration to 5-10 minutes for faster processing
- Ensure stable internet connection for uploads
- Use appropriate video resolution (720p recommended)
