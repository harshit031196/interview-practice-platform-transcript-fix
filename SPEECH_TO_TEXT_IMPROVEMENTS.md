# Speech-to-Text Improvements

## Overview of Recent Fixes

This document summarizes the improvements made to resolve Speech-to-Text API timeout issues, particularly focusing on the HTTP 408 Request Timeout errors encountered during long streaming sessions.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Timeout Handling

- **Extended timeout values**: Increased gRPC client timeout from default to 60 seconds
- **Configured keepalive settings**: Added keepalive time (10s) and keepalive timeout (5s) parameters
- **AbortController integration**: Set appropriate fetch timeouts to prevent stuck requests

### 2. Retry Mechanism

- **Exponential backoff**: Implemented progressive delays between retry attempts (1s, 2s, 4s...)
- **Retry limits**: Added configurable maximum retry attempts to prevent infinite loops
- **Error detection**: Added specific handling for both DEADLINE_EXCEEDED and HTTP 408 error types

### 3. Audio Chunk Optimization

- **Chunk size tuning**: Optimized to 1.5 seconds per chunk (1500ms)
- **Processing interval alignment**: Ensured processing interval matches chunk creation timing
- **Reduced network overhead**: Fewer, slightly larger chunks reduce connection management overhead

### 4. Transcript Preservation

- **Session storage backup**: Stored interim transcripts in browser session storage
- **Fallback mechanism**: Implemented recovery using accumulated transcripts when final result fails
- **Stream reconnection**: Maintained transcript context during stream reconnections

### 5. Error Monitoring

- **Enhanced logging**: Added detailed error tracking and performance metrics
- **Debug mode**: Implemented optional debug mode for detailed performance monitoring
- **Testing tools**: Added test script for simulating various latency and timeout conditions

## Configuration Options

The following environment variables are now available in `.env.local`:

```
SPEECH_TO_TEXT_CLIENT_TIMEOUT="60000"
SPEECH_TO_TEXT_CHUNK_INTERVAL_MS="1500"
SPEECH_TO_TEXT_MAX_RETRIES="3"
SPEECH_TO_TEXT_RETRY_DELAY_MS="1000"
SPEECH_TO_TEXT_KEEPALIVE_TIME_MS="10000"
SPEECH_TO_TEXT_KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT_MS="5000"
SPEECH_TO_TEXT_DEBUG_MODE="true"
```

## Testing

A test script `test-speech-streaming.js` has been added to simulate streaming with variable latency and intermittent timeouts. Run it with:

```
node test-speech-streaming.js
```

The test simulates progressively increasing latency and random timeout errors to verify the system's resilience.

## Results

These improvements have significantly enhanced the reliability of real-time transcription:

- **Eliminated HTTP 408 errors** during normal streaming operations
- **Improved recovery from network glitches** with smart retry logic
- **Enhanced transcript quality** by preserving context across reconnections
- **Reduced overall latency** through optimized chunk size and processing
- **Better error reporting** for easier troubleshooting
